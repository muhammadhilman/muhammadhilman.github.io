I am a computer systems enthusiast interested in ***networks, clouds, and distributed systems***. I got a PhD in workflow systems, cloud scheduling, and resource management from Melbourne CLOUDS Laboratory, The University of Melbourne.

Currently, I am working with students at Universitas Indonesia on a real-time distributed system based on various approaches, including publish/subscribe techniques, fog computing architecture, real-time communication, and future-generation network protocols.

Nevertheless, I am open to interdisciplinary computing research that is closely related to my area of expertise (but not limited to):

* ***Cybersecurity and Cryptography***: zero trust architecture, smart contracts, and blockchain technology.
* ***Intelligent Systems***: real-time analytics, online incremental machine learning, IoT, and intelligent systems.
* ***Software Engineering***: automated cloud deployment, cloud service discovery, microservices orchestration, and service mesh.

I am available to supervise prospective Master's and PhD students at the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia.
