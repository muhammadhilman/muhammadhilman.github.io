As a computer systems enthusiast with a keen interest in ***networks, clouds, and distributed systems***, I got a PhD in workflow systems, cloud scheduling, and resource management from Melbourne CLOUDS Laboratory, The University of Melbourne.

At present, I am engaged in three flagship projects with students at Universitas Indonesia, and we are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible in our field.

* **Real-time Streaming Infrastructures** includes research on distributed event streaming platforms, publish/subscribe techniques, and low-latency transport protocols with a focus on Kafka.
* **GPU-based HPC Infrastructures** includes research on CUDA and ROCm code portability and the HPC infrastructure management platform.
* **Container Orchestration** includes research on resource management of Kubernetes clusters and serverless platforms. 

Moreover, I am eager to explore interdisciplinary computing research that aligns with my expertise, particularly in the areas of:

* ***Cybersecurity and Cryptography***: zero trust architecture, smart contracts, and blockchain technology.
* ***Intelligent Systems***: real-time analytics, online incremental machine learning and IoT.
* ***Software Engineering***: automated cloud deployment, cloud service discovery, microservices orchestration, and service mesh.

I am available to supervise prospective Master's and PhD students at the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia.
